Backend- Python  

Framework - Flask  

Frontend - HTML/CSS/JS  

API- https://www.themoviedb.org/

This application provides all the details of the requested movie such as overview, genre, release date, rating, runtime, top cast, reviews, recommended movies.
The details of the movies(title, genre, runtime, rating, poster, etc) are fetched using an API by TMDB, https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api, and using the IMDB id of the movie in the API, I did web scraping to get the reviews given by the user in the IMDB site using `beautifulsoup4` and performed sentiment analysis on those reviews.
